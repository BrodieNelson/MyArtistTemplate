## Personal AI-assisted build, quality-controlled

This site was built with my own custom AI-assisted workflow that focuses on **revision and review**, not one-shot generation.  
The goal: ship faster *without* the usual “looks AI-made” vibe.

Highlights:
- Multi-pass drafting → critique → rewrite loops
- Style/brand consistency checks across pages
- Manual final polish on copy and UX
